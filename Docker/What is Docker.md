Docker is an open-source platform designed to help developers build, ship, and run applications in a consistent and efficient manner by using containerization. It enables you to package an application along with all of its dependencies, libraries, and configurations into a lightweight, portable container that can run consistently across different environments, whether itâ€™s your local machine, a development server, or in production on cloud infrastructure.
