1. Consistency Across Environments:
   Docker allows you to package your application and all of its dependencies into a single container. This ensures that it runs the same way in development, testing, and production environments

2. Isolation:
   Containers run in isolation, meaning that different applications can run on the same host without conflicting with each other.

3. Efficiency:
   Docker containers are lightweight compared to virtual machines (VMs) because they share the host operating systemâ€™s kernel. This results in less overhead and faster startup times.

4. Portability:
   Docker containers can run on any system that has Docker installed, whether it's a laptop, server, or cloud environment.

5. Scalability:
   Docker makes it easy to scale applications by allowing multiple instances of containers to be run in parallel, helping to handle increased load.
