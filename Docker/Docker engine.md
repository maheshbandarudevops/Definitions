Docker Engine:

The Docker Engine is the core part of Docker, which creates and manages containers. It runs on your host machine and provides the environment to run containers.
It consists of:
Docker Daemon: Manages Docker objects like containers, images, networks, and volumes.
Docker CLI (Command-Line Interface): Allows you to interact with Docker using commands (e.g., docker run, docker build, etc.).
