1. Microservices: Docker is widely used in microservices architectures to deploy individual services in    their own containers.

2. CI/CD Pipelines: Docker is integral to many continuous integration/continuous deployment (CI/CD)     pipelines, as it allows applications to be built, tested, and deployed in a consistent environment.

3. Cloud Deployment: Many cloud providers (AWS, GCP, Azure) support Docker, enabling seamless container orchestration and scaling

In summary, Docker simplifies application development and deployment by using containers to ensure consistency, portability, and efficiency across different environments
